## Introduction
Design patterns for object orientated programs are divided into three broad categories listed below. These are the same categories used by GoF in their seminal work on design patterns.

* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioural

Each of these are explained below.

## Creational
Creational design patterns relate to how objects are constructed from classes. New-ing up objects may sound trivial but unthoughtfully littering code with object instance creations can lead to headaches down the road. The creational design pattern come with powerful suggestions on how best to encapsulate the object creation process in a program.

* Builder Pattern
* Prototype Pattern
* Singleton Pattern
* Abstract Factory Pattern

## Structural
Structural patterns are concerned with the composition of classes i.e. how the classes are made up or constructed. These include:

* Adapter Pattern
* Bridge Pattern
* Composite Pattern
* Decorator Pattern
* Farcade Pattern
* Flyweight Pattern
* Proxy Pattern

## Behavioural
Behavioral design patterns dictate the interaction of classes and objects amongst each other and the delegation of responsibility. These include:

* Interpreter Pattern
* Template Pattern
* Chain of Responsibility Pattern
* Command Pattern
* Iterator Pattern
* Mediator Pattern
* Memento Pattern
* Observer Pattern
* State Pattern
* Strategy Pattern
* Visitor Pattern
